# MTGCardTextGenerator-RNN_ML

A text generator for MTG Cards! Using Keras to build the LSTMs, it creates cards by predicting the next character. Training data is MTG cards pulled from Scryfall's API. Results are more humorous than actually "playable".

# Examples
<endofcost> destroy target tapped creature without flying and each player any player may activate this ability only during your turn before attackers are declared

Talk about niche

<cardname> exiles the top card of their library if it's a land card from or more hatchling counters on it remove all of them and transform it

What?

<cardname> becomes a kithkin spirit warrior avatar with base power and toughness 4/8 until end of turn

Perfect for my kithkin spirit warrior avatar tribal deck!
